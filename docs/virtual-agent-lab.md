## Step Wise Execution : The Mental Model

1. This is just a clear way that man and AI can communicate with clarity
    - We want to set goals, not instructions
    - Clarity is the key to success here because you are dealing with very high IQ here
    - We need focused queries to get best value from the AI model (LLM)
    - Here is some perspective.

2. A word for the wise (we used AI to generate this wisdom):
    
    ![image.png](assets/virtual_agent/image_1.png)
    
3. Our mental model will be **Step Wise Execution**. 
    1. Each big task will be broken into small chunks. 
    2. We shall take time to explain everything to the AI like a child. 
    3. Clarity and verbosity is the best simplicity
    4. How does this translate? Example steps to collect a order:

```

    - Step 1.4. Ask the customer for the best time to deliver the battery.
- Step 2. Ask the customer to confirm their order information from Step 1.
    - Step 2.1. To maintain clarity, use bullet points to lay out the confirmation information.
- Step 3. Send payment information to the customer to pay for the battery.
    - Step 3.1. To maintain clarity, use bullet points to lay out the payment information.
    - Step 3.2. Payment will be done with the following MPESA details:
