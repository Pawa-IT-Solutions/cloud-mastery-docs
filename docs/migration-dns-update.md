# Accessing your Migrated Application

The final step of the migration is to use your VM instance's external IP address to confirm that the application is up

## Identify Your New IP Address

First, confirm the public IP address of your newly created VM.

1.  Navigate to the **Compute Engine > VM Instances** page in the Google Cloud Console.
2.  Locate your VM (`pawait-vm-gcp-final`).
3.  Copy the value from the **External IP** column. This is your new server address.

You can paste it on a new tab on a browser of your choice
